# sortr
A python script to categorise ID3-tagged music (such as that obtained from ripped CDs) into folders based upon the metadata provided. This was primarily for helping to organise my Plex library, as well as allow for portability onto other devices

> This was hacked together for my own personal use and has not been updated in several years - as such, it may not work anymore (although it might be a good starting point for a similar project in future)

Built using Mutagen, a library for extracting ID3 data.

## usage

- Modify the directory to where your music is stored
- Run the script, selecting a mode from the options provided

For transcoding, place a copy of `ffmpeg.exe` in the execution directory (tested with version 5.0)

enjoy!
